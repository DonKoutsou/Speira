If you are going to be out there with my boys i want to make sure that they have someone they can trust next to them."

So unless you agree to participate we cant sell you guns, but that doesent stop you from getting them in your own ways. Enough about that tho, come see me when you find some clues about your brother. Take these forged papers, you will be able to use them to talk with soviet soldiers without them atacking you. Dont give it to any high ranking officers, they will realise its a fluke."
