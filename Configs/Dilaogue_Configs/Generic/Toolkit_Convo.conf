   ActionText "Any ideas on how to get those rocks of the ground?"
   DialogueText "There are single use toolkits you can get your hands on. Those rocks are pretty hard so unless you have the money for something more expensive this will be the thing for you."

   ActionText "Any chance you got any for sale?"
   DialogueText "I'd be fine to sell you one of my toolkits but thats all i'll give away. I'll give it to you for 4 watches, i think its a fair trade, each of those rocks go for 3 times that."
